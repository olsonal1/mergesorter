# A merge sorter for comparable elements

Mergesort is a simple and very common algorithm for sorting comparable elements.

The algorithm has quite a few variations: you can read more about it in CLRS (or by its proper title, "Introduction to Algorithms" by Charles E. Leiserson, Clifford Stein, Ronald Rivest, and Thomas H. Cormen.

Here, we implement it in python: we'll assume that we already have a list of elements, and- if they're not already integers- a function to cheaply compare them.

If you'd like to use this for whatever (non-plagiarizing) reason, feel free! (But please attribute it).
